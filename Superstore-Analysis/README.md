# Superstore Category-State Sales Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes product sales by category and U.S. state to guide decisions on which products to continue, expand, or discontinue. It simulates executive decision-making for a retail company based on regional demand.

## 🧠 What I Did
- Used Excel and Tableau to break down sales performance by category and region
- Highlighted trends in profit margins and volume across different U.S. states
- Designed an interactive Tableau dashboard to clearly display KPIs and product insights
